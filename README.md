Personal Portfolio — Nischint Singh ✦

A motion-driven personal portfolio designed to present work through clarity, rhythm, and interaction.
This site is not a traditional showcase—it is an authored experience where design and motion work together to communicate intent.

Independently designed and developed, the project reflects a studio-grade approach executed by a single creator.

About the Experience 🎬

Interaction shapes perception.
Scrolling, transitions, and hover states are treated as compositional tools—guiding attention, creating flow, and revealing content with purpose.

Motion is embedded into the design system itself, ensuring the experience feels cohesive, fluid, and deliberate rather than decorative.
