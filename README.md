Personal Portfolio — Nischint Singh ✦

A motion-driven personal portfolio crafted to present work through clarity, rhythm, and interaction.
This is not a conventional showcase—it is an authored digital experience where design, motion, and intent operate as a unified system.

Every element has been independently designed and developed, reflecting a studio-grade mindset executed by a single creator.

About the Experience 🎬

Interaction defines perception.

Scrolling, transitions, and hover states are treated as compositional tools—guiding focus, establishing flow, and revealing content with intent rather than spectacle. Motion is not layered on top of the interface; it is embedded directly into the design system.

The result is an experience that feels cohesive, fluid, and deliberate, prioritizing rhythm and restraint over excess.

Design Philosophy ✦

● Motion as narrative, not decoration
● Clarity over complexity
● Minimalism with intent
● Interfaces that feel alive yet controlled
● Visual rhythm that supports content, not distracts from it

This portfolio reflects a way of thinking—iterative, detail-oriented, and deeply intentional.

Technical Foundation ⚙️

● GSAP — animation architecture, sequencing, and motion control
● Lenis.js — smooth, responsive scrolling behavior
● Vanilla JavaScript & CSS — full creative control and performance awareness
● Custom cursor & interaction logic — spatial feedback and engagement
● Fully responsive layout — refined breakpoints across devices

The stack is intentionally minimal, allowing design and motion decisions to remain the focus.

Defining Qualities ✨

● Motion-first design approach
● Designed and developed end-to-end by a single individual
● Purpose-driven, performance-aware animations
● Interactive feedback through micro-interactions
